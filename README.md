## Sleep Tracker

In todayâ€™s society, pulling all-nighters has become normalized amongst university students. 
After my first year of university I truly understood the importance of sleep and how it factors into your daily 
performance. Getting a full 8 hours of sleep, I was able to see a dramatic difference in my ability to focus and retain 
information which translated into positive changes in my social, academic and personal life. Having an application 
which helps you record your sleep time as well as calculating a weekly average can be motivating and push you to fulfill
your daily goal as well as giving you the opportunity to see any patterns or shifts in sleeping habits. The act of 
tracking is likely to create a positive habit of getting to sleep on time.
